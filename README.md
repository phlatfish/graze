## A visually appealing database for you to share your art!

Graze is a web-based art database that allows you to upload your own art or just any image file you find important! This project contains HTML, CSS, and Flask files, along with an "static" folder that holds various images and code. In this README, we will guide both newcomers and experienced developers through the key aspects of this project.

This project is made for RidgeHacks 2024 by **Tharun Naguleswaran, Dhruv Rakhade, and Alex Sheng**. Special thanks to Calum Dingwall for recording our video.

## Usage
For Newbies
If you're new to web development or just want to use the application, here's a simple guide:

Open the file uploader by following the "Getting Started" steps.

1. You'll see an input field labeled "Upload." Enter your files here. For example, you can upload dhruvrakhadeforpresident.png to get a stunning image of Dhruv!
2. Press the "Upload" button, and the file will appear on the internet.

Experiment with different files and see how the database changes in real-time.

## Customization
Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the homepage, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.

- The Flask code for this project can be found in the app.py file. We also use jQuery for sleek JavaScript operations.

- The code listens for form submissions using jQuery. When the form is submitted, it retrieves the file from the user's computer, and uploads it into our safe and secure database.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
